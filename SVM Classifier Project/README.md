# SVM classifier on breast cancer dataset

## Objective
Evaluate the performance of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with different kernels on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Approach
- **Dataset**: Used the `load_breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn`.
- **Model**: Implemented Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with two different kernels: `linear` and `rbf`.
- **Evaluation**: Calculated the accuracy of the SVC model for each kernel on the test dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and storing results.
- **Plotly**: For visualizing the results as a bar chart.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: 
  - `load_breast_cancer`: For loading the dataset.
  - `train_test_split`: To split the dataset into training and test sets.
  - `SVC`: For Support Vector Classifier.
  - `accuracy_score`: For measuring the model's accuracy.

## Results
The accuracy of SVC with different kernels is plotted and displayed using Plotly.
