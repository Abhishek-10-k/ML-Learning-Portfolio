# Machine Learning Lab Manual

This directory contains a **Machine Learning Lab Manual** consisting of 10 practical projects aimed at **beginners** and **intermediate** learners. If you are new to the field of machine learning, this manual will guide you through various **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **ensemble learning algorithms**.

## Structure of Each Practical:
Each project is divided into 4 sections:
1. **Objective**: A brief overview of the project's goal.
2. **Code**: The implementation of the machine learning model.
3. **Results**: The output and results obtained from the code.
4. **Conclusion**: A summary of the findings and key takeaways.

## Topics Covered:
- **Supervised Learning**: Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-means clustering, PCA, etc.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Random forest, gradient boosting, etc.

This manual is a **great starting point** for anyone looking to begin their machine learning journey. It provides hands-on practice and a step-by-step approach to understanding core ML algorithms.

Whether you're starting from scratch or polishing your skills, this manual is designed to be **your first step** in mastering machine learning.
