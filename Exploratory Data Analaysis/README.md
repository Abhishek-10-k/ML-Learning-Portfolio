# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**. The aim of the analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights related to heart disease, which will help in preparing the data for future predictive modeling. Through this EDA, we handle key aspects like data preprocessing, outlier detection, and visualization to set the foundation for building robust machine learning models.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.
  - Verified that the target class has equal representation, ensuring unbiased models.
  - Confirmed no missing values, ensuring clean data for analysis.
  - Checked for multicollinearity to build stable and interpretable models.

- **Insights and Findings**:
  - Certain features do not follow a normal distribution and may require transformation.
  - Outliers were detected, and methods for handling them are necessary to avoid skewing the model.
  - No multicollinearity found among independent variables, reducing the risk of model instability.

- **Recommendations for Future Modeling**:
  - Apply transformations (e.g., log or Box-Cox) to normalize non-normal variables.
  - Consider robust methods to handle outliers, such as robust scaling or removing extreme values.
  - Explore tree-based algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) which are robust to non-normality and outliers.
  - Employ cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting graphs.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.

## Visualizations
Various visualizations were created to explore the relationships between features and the target variable, including:
- **Scatter Plots**
- **Pair Plots**
- **Box Plots**
- **Histograms**
- **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Violin Plots**
- **Count Plots**
- **Bar Plots**
- **Density Plots**

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a thorough understanding of the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. It prepares the data for predictive modeling by addressing potential issues like non-normal distributions and outliers. The insights gained from this analysis lay the groundwork for building accurate, reliable machine learning models for heart disease diagnosis.

## Next Steps
The next steps involve:
- Data transformation to meet algorithm assumptions.
- Feature engineering to capture more insights from the data.
- Implementation of machine learning models with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
